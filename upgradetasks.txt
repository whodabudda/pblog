upgrade ruby
check version of rvm

install Yarn
copy packge.json and run yarn to install node modules for webpacker

Add database changes:
	-prefer adding migration scripts and letting Capistrano handle the install
	-otherwise, compare tables and manually make changes

Gemfile will have the gems needed
	- Capistrano will run bundle install
	- check webpack - had to take from git 'master' in development to get over a bug that hadn't
	  yet been packaged for distribution.  May be packaged by the time this goes production.

add systemd setup for redis, sidekiq, and puma
	- check Puma.rb - will be different in production for systemd setup
	- initializer for sidekiq - will be different in production for systemd setup
