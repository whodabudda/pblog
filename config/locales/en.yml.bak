# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

 comment_review_status:
     - code: "NOTR"
       name: Not Reviewed
       desc: >
        When you submit a comment, the site administrators will review. This review
        will determine the appropriateness of the comment. They will not judge your political, moral or
        world view.  Thoughtful opinions are allowed, but rhetoric is not. 

        Anything in the content
        that is claimed as a 'fact' must be supported with at least one reference, and 
        that reference must be judged to be a credible source. References will be checked.
        The reference cannot be just another opinion or uncredentialed claim.  The bias of this site
        credits science over faith, without appology or argument. Greater weight will be given to statistics
        from politically unaligned sources than ones with obvious bias.  For example, the federal Office of
        Management and Budget has credibility as an objective source.  The Heritage Foundation less so.  So
        for example if your facts are supported purely with statistics from the Heritage Foundation, the admin 
        may ask you for references from other sources and to reconcile the different claims, or to expunge the
        fact.  This approach is designed to minimise the dissemination of mis-information created by propaganda
        organizations, and to emphasize information from nonpartizan sources.

        Examples of references are:
          links to other web sites
          subscript or superscript number in the text with footnotes or bibliography at the bottom of the comment
          inline description of where the fact was published

        References to books should include the Author, Title, and page number.
        References to articles or research papers should include the publication name, year, issue, and title.

        Once approved, your comment will appear on the site.

        Until it is reviewed and approved, your comment will appear as 'pending'. 

        It is possible for you to acquire a trusted status, where your comments will appear
        immediately without the requirement for review.  

     - code: "RANT"
       name: Is a Rant 
       desc: >
        If the admin determines the entry to be an unsupportable and-or
        venemous spewing of rhetoric, it will be labeled a rant and 
        relegated to the rant file.  It can be viewed under the Rants heading.

     - code: "NREV"
       name: Needs Revision
       desc: >
        If the admin determines that there are insufficient or uncredentialed references 
        to support the 'facts', or the comment is not on topic, the author will be asked
        to revise, and the comment will be retained for revision  
        afor 30 days.  After that time, if the entry
        is not modified to standards, it will be re-classified as rejected. If you disagree
        with the admins decision, you may appeal by selecting the 'appeal' dropdown menu. You will
        be able to view all your appeals and responses from the admins on one page.  Only the admins and 
        yourself will be able to see your appeals.

     - code: "NEJK"
       name: Rejected 
       desc: >
        The entry has been rejected because the author failed to meet the 
        documentation standards of the site.
