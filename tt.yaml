   When you submit a comment, the site administrators will review. 
   If the admin determines the entry to be an unsupportable and-or
   venemous spewing of rhetoric, it will be labeled a rant and 
   relegated to the rant file.  It can be viewed under the Rants heading.

 NREV:
  name: Needs Revision
  desc: >
   When you submit a comment, the site administrators will review.

   to support the 'facts' or is not on topic, the entry will be given this status 
   and held for update for 30 days.  After that time, if the entry
   is not modified to standards, it will be re-classified as rejected.

 NEJK:
